    <h1>What is WEB-DESIGNING ?</h1>
    <p> Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually refers to the user
      <br> experience aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused<br>  on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.<br> 
       
      <br> 
      <br> 

      A web designer works on the appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content of a website. Appearance, for <br> instance, relates to the colors, font, and images used. Layout refers to how information is structured and <br> categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the<br>  website. Many webpages are designed with a focus on simplicity, so that no extraneous information and functionality that might distract or confuse users appears. As the keystone of a web designer’s output is a site <br> that wins and fosters the trust of the target audience, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible is a critical consideration.<br> 

      <br> 
      <br> 
      
      Two of the most common methods for designing websites that work well both on desktop and mobile are responsive <br> and adaptive design. In responsive design, content moves dynamically depending on screen size; in adaptive <br> design, the website content is fixed in layout sizes that match common screen sizes. Preserving a layout that is as consistent as possible between devices is crucial to maintaining user trust and engagement. As <br> responsive design can present difficulties in this regard, designers must be careful in relinquishing control of <br> how their work will appear. If they are responsible for the content as well, while they may need to broaden their skillset, they will enjoy having the advantage of full control of the finished product.<br>
